# Data Analysis

- Data Analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, and is used in different business, science, and social science domains. In today's business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively.

## Mean

- The mean is the average of the numbers: a calculated "central" value of a set of numbers. To calculate: Just add up all the numbers, then divide by how many numbers there are.
- The mean is the sum of all the numbers in the data set divided by the number of values in the data set.
- The mean is also known as the average.

## Median

- The median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers and can be more descriptive of that data set than the average.
- The median is the middle value of a data set. To find the median, order the numbers and see which one is in the middle of the list.
- The median is also the number that is halfway into the set. To find the median, the data should be arranged in order from least to greatest.

## Mode

- The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a data set. A set of data may have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all.
- The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a data set.
- A set of data may have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all.

## Range

- The range is the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in a data set.

## Outliers

- An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations. An outlier may be due to variability in the measurement or it may indicate experimental error; the latter are sometimes excluded from the data set.

##### Example

85, 91, 83, 78, 79, 64, 81, 97

- Mean: (85 + 91 + 83 + 78 + 79 + 64 + 81 + 97) / 8 = 79.75
- Median: 81
- Mode: No mode
- Range: 97 - 64 = 33
- Outliers: None

# Statistics

- Any raw Data when collected and organized in the formof tables, charts, graphs, etc. is called Statistics.
- Statistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.
- There are generally 3 kinds of averages commonly used in Statistics:
  - Mean (Sum/Count)
  - Median (Middle number)
  - Mode (Most frequent number)
- Collecting, classifying, and summarizing data are called Statistics.

## Types of Statistics

1. Descriptive Statistics
2. Inferential Statistics

### 1. Descriptive Statistics

- In the descriptive Statistics, we simply describe in a summarized way.
- The summarization is done from the sample of the population(huge amount of data) using different parameters like Mean or standard deviation.
- Descriptive Statistics is used to describe the basic features of the data in a study. It provides simple summaries about the sample and the measures.

#### Measure of Central Tendency

- The measure of central tendency is a value that describes a data set. These values are the mean, median, and mode.

#### Measures of Dispersion in Statistics

- Measures of dispersion are used to describe the spread of the data. These values are the range, variance, mean deviation and standard deviation.

#### Different types of distribution of data

- Bernoulli Distribution
- Binomial Distribution
- Poisson Distribution
- Normal Distribution
- Uniform Distribution
- Exponential Distribution
- Gaussian Distribution

### 2. Inferential Statistics

- In the Inferential Statistics, we try to interpret the Meaning of descriptive Statistics. After the Data has been collected, analyzed, and summarized, we can draw conclusions about the population from which the sample was taken.
- Inferential Statistics use the probablity principle to assess whether trends contained in the research sample can be generalized to the larger population from which the sample was drawn.

#### Measures of inferential Statistics are:

- T-test
- Z-test
- Chi-square test
- Anova test
- Hypothesis testing
- P-Value
- Significance value

## Stages of Statistics

1. Collection of Data
2. Organization of Data
3. Presentation of Data
4. Analysis of Data
5. Interpretation of Data
