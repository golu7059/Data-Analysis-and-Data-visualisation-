# Data Analysis

- Data Analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, and is used in different business, science, and social science domains. In today's business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively.

## Mean

- The mean is the average of the numbers: a calculated "central" value of a set of numbers. To calculate: Just add up all the numbers, then divide by how many numbers there are.
- The mean is the sum of all the numbers in the data set divided by the number of values in the data set.
- The mean is also known as the average.

## Median

- The median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers and can be more descriptive of that data set than the average.
- The median is the middle value of a data set. To find the median, order the numbers and see which one is in the middle of the list.
- The median is also the number that is halfway into the set. To find the median, the data should be arranged in order from least to greatest.

## Mode

- The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a data set. A set of data may have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all.
- The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a data set.
- A set of data may have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all.

## Range

- The range is the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in a data set.

## Outliers

- An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations. An outlier may be due to variability in the measurement or it may indicate experimental error; the latter are sometimes excluded from the data set.

##### Example

85, 91, 83, 78, 79, 64, 81, 97

- Mean: (85 + 91 + 83 + 78 + 79 + 64 + 81 + 97) / 8 = 79.75
- Median: 81
- Mode: No mode
- Range: 97 - 64 = 33
- Outliers: None

# Statistics

- Any raw Data when collected and organized in the formof tables, charts, graphs, etc. is called Statistics.
- Statistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.
- There are generally 3 kinds of averages commonly used in Statistics:
  - Mean (Sum/Count)
  - Median (Middle number)
  - Mode (Most frequent number)
- Collecting, classifying, and summarizing data are called Statistics.

## Types of Statistics

1. Descriptive Statistics
2. Inferential Statistics

### 1. Descriptive Statistics

- In the descriptive Statistics, we simply describe in a summarized way.
- The summarization is done from the sample of the population(huge amount of data) using different parameters like Mean or standard deviation.
- Descriptive Statistics is used to describe the basic features of the data in a study. It provides simple summaries about the sample and the measures.

#### Measure of Central Tendency

- The measure of central tendency is a value that describes a data set. These values are the mean, median, and mode.

#### Measures of Dispersion in Statistics

- Measures of dispersion are used to describe the spread of the data. These values are the range, variance, mean deviation and standard deviation.

#### Different types of distribution of data

- Bernoulli Distribution
- Binomial Distribution
- Poisson Distribution
- Normal Distribution
- Uniform Distribution
- Exponential Distribution
- Gaussian Distribution

### 2. Inferential Statistics

- In the Inferential Statistics, we try to interpret the Meaning of descriptive Statistics. After the Data has been collected, analyzed, and summarized, we can draw conclusions about the population from which the sample was taken.
- Inferential Statistics use the probablity principle to assess whether trends contained in the research sample can be generalized to the larger population from which the sample was drawn.

#### Measures of inferential Statistics are:

- T-test
- Z-test
- Chi-square test
- Anova test
- Hypothesis testing
- P-Value
- Significance value

## Stages of Statistics

1. Collection of Data
2. Organization of Data
3. Presentation of Data
4. Analysis of Data
5. Interpretation of Data

## Measure of Dispersion

- Dispersoion is the state of getting dispersed or spread 
- means the extend to which numerical data is likely to vary about an average value.
- In other words, dispersion helps to understand the distribution of the data.

#### Ojective of Measuring Dispersion 
- To determine the realiability of an average 
- To compare the variablility of two or more series
- for facilitating the use of other statistical measures
- Basis of Staticla Quality Control

#### Properties of a good 
- Easy to understand 
- Simple to calculate 
- Uniquiley defined 
- Based on all observations
- Not affected by extreme observations
- Capable of further algebric treatment

### Measures of Dispersion 
1. Absolute : Expressed in the same units in which data is expressed . 
- Eg : Rupees , Kgs , Ltr , etc
2. Relative : In the form of ration or percentage . so , independent of units 
- also called `coefficient of dispersions `

### Methods of Measuring Dispersion

1. **Range**
2. **Interquartile Range and Quartile Deviation**
3. **Mean Deviation**
4. **Standard Deviation**
5. **Coefficient of Variation**
6. **Lorenz Curve**

#### 1. Range
- It is the simplest measure of dispersion.
- It is defined as the difference between the highest and lowest values in a data set.
- **Formula:** Range = Maximum Value - Minimum Value.
- It gives a quick sense of the spread but is sensitive to outliers.

#### 2. Interquartile Range (IQR) and Quartile Deviation
- IQR measures the range within which the middle 50% of values lie.
- Defined as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1).
- **Formula:** IQR = Q3 - Q1.
- Quartile Deviation (QD) is half of the IQR.
- Less affected by outliers and extreme values.

#### 3. Mean Deviation
- It measures the average of the absolute deviations of values from the mean.
- **Formula:** Mean Deviation = (Σ|xi - mean|) / N, where xi represents each value and N is the number of values.
- Provides a straightforward measure of spread but does not consider the direction of deviation.

#### 4. Standard Deviation
- It measures the average distance of each value from the mean.
- **Formula:** Standard Deviation (σ) = √[Σ(xi - mean)² / N].
- It is widely used in statistics and provides insight into data variability.
- Considers both the magnitude and direction of deviations.

#### 5. Coefficient of Variation
- It is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, expressed as a percentage.
- **Formula:** CV = (Standard Deviation / Mean) × 100.
- Useful for comparing the degree of variation between datasets with different units or means.

#### 6. Lorenz Curve
- It is a graphical representation of the distribution of income or wealth.
- Plots the cumulative percentage of total income received against the cumulative percentage of recipients.
- Helps in understanding inequality and concentration of wealth or income in a population.
